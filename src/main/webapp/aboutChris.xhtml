            <p>
                Hello!
                My name is Christopher Recinos.
                I am a student in your class! I am excited about the closing of this
                semester and look forward to my final semester in my CS program!
                This class has not been super fun but the experience has taught me
                new things and that is the most important part of it all.
                Thank you for taking the time to read this, I wish you a Merry
                Christmas and hope you have a happy and warm time with your family!
                
                Christopher Recinos
            </p>
