            <p>
                Hello, my name is Trevin Kotinek.  I am a senior at UNO majoring in
                Computer Science and I graduate on Friday!  In fact, this is my final college assignment!
                I enjoy coding in Java and Python, and developing web applications is a fun hobby of 
                mine so this class has been very interesting.  Outside of school/work I enjoy sports
                and working out.  You can always find me rooting for the Kansas City Chiefs or any 
                Nebraska Cornhusker athletics.
            </p>
